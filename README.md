Dynamic web map of Wisconsin rivers and waterbodies.
This map was created using the opensource software Qgis to create, modify, and edit the static a static map of Wisconsin showing different levels of streams and waterbodies. The data was obtained from The National Map Small-Scale website. Several of the map elements proved challenging in the process of creating this map. First, in an attempt to decrease the pixalation of the map images, particularly the high resolution map, the width and height dimensions changed. The instructions clearly specided width speficiations which prevented increasing the pixelation resolution. Second, visualizing the stream order was also a challenge to visualize appropriate, particularly given the scale that was specified (1:1,000,0000). I addressed this by deviating from the all-blue color scheme for streams and assigning green hues to the lower order streams which helped distinguish them from higher order streams.

Key lessons learned:
<li>Practice opening a variety of geographic data with QGIS and viewing their attributes within QGIS</li>
<li>Create and export a map layout as a static image file</li>
<li>Working with basic HTML elements and CSS style rules to change the web page appearance (e.g. text, lists, page sizing)</li>
<li>Working with the Print Layout feature of Qgis to insert a legend, title, text box, arrange map elements</li>
<li>Adding background image using Qgis</li>
<li>Publishing a static map to a web page</li>
<li>Using images as hyperlinks in a dynamic web map</li>
</ul>
